# Plan
# First make a hash
# take each string and split and sort it
# Save the string as the key and the split/sorted array as the value.
# Now I have a hash of string:array pairs
# Take my first hash key and put it in an array.
# check to see if my hash value matches any other hash value in the hash.
# If so push the second has key to my array and go through the entire hash this way.
# Push entire array to final array and repeat
